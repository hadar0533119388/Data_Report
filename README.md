number of words in the file: 19
number of unique words in the file: 10
average sentence length: 2.7142857142857144
maximum sentence length: 4
the longest word sequence in a text that does not contain the letter k: ['to', 'eat', 'i', 'always', 'eat', 'i', 'eat', 'pizze', 'i', 'blue', 'blue', 'red', 'i', 'i', 'blue']
